# M2Lyon2425
This is the repository for the Lean courses of the program <a href="http://mathematiques.ens-lyon.fr/parcours-2024-2025-394652.kjsp">"Higher Algebra and Formalised Mathematics"</a> of the Advanced Master in Mathematics in Lyon for 2024/25.

## Some tips
To download the repository and start working on it, you need
* a working `git` installation: for some help, you
can have a look at <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/misc/git.html">this page maintained by Patrick Massot</a>.
* a Lean editor (we suggest that you install VSCode) and a working Lean environment: you can follow the instructions on the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html">Lean community webpage</a>. If you encounter problems, you can come to the "Installation party" on September 4th to get some help.
* An account on the <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip chat app</a>: once you've got it, subscribe to the <a href="https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/">Lean Community Chat</a> and ask to one of the teachers to be invited to join the dedicated stream for this course.
